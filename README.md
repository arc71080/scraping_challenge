Challenge 11 - scraping 

## Background

This challenge had two parts: 
1. Scraping titles and preview text from Mars News - using Beautiful Soup I extracted the title and preview from the news articles.
2. Scraping and analyzing Mars weather data - using Beautiful Soup i extracted the table from the websit to answer the questions:

How many months exist on Mars? 12

How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset? 1867

What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 

Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 

About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
